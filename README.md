# Nsuku Sambo - SDE Portfolio

Computer Engineering graduate targeting intern/grad/junior Software Development Engineer roles. I focus on problem solving with data structures and algorithms, writing clean code, and debugging real systems. AWS experience is a supporting signal for distributed systems fundamentals, not the main identity.
